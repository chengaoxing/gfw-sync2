        "Overview": "This is a higher resolution data product that expands upon the methodology presented in Baccini et al. (2012) to generate a pan-tropical map of aboveground live woody biomass density at 30 m resolution for circa the year 2000. Along with the carbon density values, there is an error map at the same spatial resolution providing the uncertainty in aboveground carbon density estimation. These maps allow for the co-location of biomass estimates with Hansen et al. (2013, v1.0) tree cover loss estimates at similar spatial resolution. The statistical relationship derived between ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and co-located Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics as described by Baccini et al. (2012) were used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics. Then, using randomForest models, the GLAS-derived estimates of biomass density were correlated to continuous, gridded variables including Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products (e.g., reflectance), elevation, and biophysical variables. By using continuous gridded datasets as inputs to the randomForest models, a wall-to-wall 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics was produced as well as the associated uncertainty layer. The uncertainty layer takes into account the errors from allometric equations, LiDAR based model, and randomForest model. All the errors are propagated to the final biomass estimate. A detailed description of the work will be reported in a new paper under preparation.\n\nThe tree cover canopy density of the displayed data varies according to the selection - use the legend on the map to change the minimum tree cover canopy density threshold.",

The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35.",

The Atlantic Forest biome, which occupies the entire Brazilian continental east Atlantic coast and stretches inland in the Southeast and South, is defined by the predominant forest vegetation and diverse relief. The Pampa, restricted to Rio Grande do Sul, is defined by a set of field vegetation in plain relief. The predominant vegetation in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, second in size, extends from the Maranh\u00e3o coast to the Midwest and the Caatinga Biome, typical of semi-arid climate of the northeastern backlands.

Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.\n\nGiven the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.\n\nEach polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A \u201cgr\u201d in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:\n\nLarge industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares\nMosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use\nMosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.\nClearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)\nFor more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.",

Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.\n\nGiven the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.\n\nEach polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A \u201cgr\u201d in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:\n\nLarge industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares\nMosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use\nMosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.\nClearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)\nFor more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.",

The majority of EBAs are also important for the conservation of restricted-range species from other animal and plant groups. The unique landscapes where these bird species occur, amounting to just 4.5% of the earth's land surface, are high priorities for broad-scale ecosystem conservation.\n\nGeographically, EBAs are often islands or mountain ranges, and vary considerably in size, from a few hundred hectares to more than 10,000,000 hectares. EBAs also vary in the number of restricted-range species that they support (from two to 80). EBAs are found around the world, but most (77%) of them are located in the tropics and subtropics.",

It uses a cloud computing algorithm to analyze frequently updated satellite imagery along with complementary information on factors that affect tree cover loss, such as fires and precipitation. The system generates twice-monthly \u201calerts\u201d for the world\u2019s [humid tropical forests](http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf) that identify 500 \u00d7 500 meter areas where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred.\n\nFORMA is designed for quick identification of new areas of tree cover loss. The system analyzes data gathered daily by the [MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) sensor, which operates on NASA\u2019s Terra and Aqua satellites. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php), a measure of vegetation greenness. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are likely to indicate forest being cleared, burned, or defoliated.\n\nFORMA alerts only appear in areas where the probability of tree cover loss is greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nUpcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 \u00d7 250 meters, and expanding coverage to tropical dry forest and eventually to other biomes across the globe.\n",

Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.\n\nGiven the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.\n\nEach polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A \u201cgr\u201d in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic).

The aim of the project was to develop a service capable of delivering global composites and land cover maps using observations from the 300 meter MERIS sensor on board the ENVISAT satellite mission. ESA makes land cover maps available covering 2 periods: December 2004 - June 2006 and January - December 2009. GlobCover products come with a thematic legend compatible with the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS).\n\nData in this layer was generated using MERIS images which were classified using both a supervised (human-verified) and unsupervised (automated)classification algorithm applied at two different seasonal time steps to create land cover classes based on both spectral and temporal properties of land cover. The labeling procedure is automated and based on the GlobCover 2005 (v2.2) land cover map.

Over 35 times the size of Singapore, this majestic and ancient ecosystem covers more than 2.6 million hectares of lowland rainforests, peat swamps, montane and coastal forests and alpine meadows. Globally recognized as one of the richest expanses of tropical rainforest found anywhere in Southeast Asia, the Leuser Ecosystem is also one of Asia\u2019s largest carbon sinks. The Leuser Ecosystem is the last place on earth where orangutans, rhinos, elephants, and tigers co-exist in the wild. All four of these species are now classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Critically Endangered. The Leuser Ecosystem is the only remaining habitat left in Sumatra large enough to sustain viable populations of these species. A publication in leading international journal Science listed the Leuser Ecosystem as \u201cone of the world\u2019s foremost irreplaceable areas.\u201d\n\nThe Leuser Ecosystem is an essential asset for the economic development of Aceh, providing a total economic value of at least 350 million US dollars per year. The Leuser Ecosystem acts as a life-support system for approximately four million people in Aceh. The primary ecosystem services are fresh water provision and disaster mitigation. The forests of the Leuser Ecosystem act as a sponge, soaking up the downpours of the rainy season and spreading out the release of water downstream more evenly across the months. Deforestation of this environmentally sensitive area is having a dramatic impact by increasing the damage caused by flooding and landslides, and causing economic damage to communities and downstream industry. Locally and globally, the Leuser Ecosystem also has immense environmental value due to its role in climate regulation and carbon storage. Efforts to conserve the Leuser Ecosystem date as far back as the early 19th century, when the traditional leaders of Aceh lobbied the colonial government to protect their natural heritage, ranging from the mountains all the way down to the coast. More recent laws have served to strengthen the protection of the Leuser Ecosystem and placed the responsibility for managing its protection and restoration with the Aceh Provincial Government (Article 150 of National Law on Governing Aceh No. 11/2006). Furthermore, the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh has special legal status as a National Strategic Area for its Environmental Protection Function (26 of 2007 juncto 26/2008), prohibiting any activities that reduce that function, including cultivation and infrastructure development.",

        "Overview": "This data set indicates the location of intact and degraded primary forests across Indonesia for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2012. Primary forest consists of mature natural forest cover that has not been completely cleared in recent history (30 years or more) and exists in a contiguous block of 5 ha or more. Primary forest cover was mapped using Landsat composites and multi-temporal metrics as input data to a two-step supervised classification. The first step was a per-pixel classification of areas with tree canopy cover of 30% and above for the 2000 reference year. A second per-pixel classification procedure was performed to separate primary forest from other tree cover for 2000; contiguous areas of 5 ha and greater were retained as primary forest. A limited editing of this classification was performed to remove older plantations and adjust other forest formations that could not be identified using the per-pixel classifier, but could be identified in photo-interpretive contexts. Primary forests were subsequently characterized into primary intact and primary degraded subclasses using the GIS-based buffering approach of the Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL). To create the IFL layer, buffers of roads, settlements and other signs of human landscape alteration were used to identify degraded areas within zones of primary forest cover. IFL mapping employed cloud-free Landsat mosaics to quantify changes in primary intact forest extent. The map of primary intact and primary degraded forest cover types corresponds to the Indonesia Ministry of Forestry\u2019s primary and secondary forest cover types.",

To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2000.\n\nChanges in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2013 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as \u201creduction in extent\u201d met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.\n\nThis data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales.

        "Overview": "Economic Land Concessions (ELC) are long-term leases that allows a concessionaire to clear land in order to develop industrial-scale agriculture. In recent years, communities, local and international organizations, UN agencies, and development partners have raised many concerns about the impact of ELCs on communities and the environment. Both local and international media frequently report on cases of communities losing land to concession holders. Further, ELCs allegedly have led to deforestation as large tracts of forestland are cleared for plantations.\n\nThis dataset contains data for ELCs in Cambodia with contract dates starting from 1995 to 2012. The list was updated in June 2015 to included adjustments to ELCs contracts as a result of the Directive 01, starting in 2012, such as land cuts and cancellation of licenses. Due to the lack of publicly available information, this dataset does not include information on reductions of contract durations as a result of the ELCs evaluation process in 2015.\n\nOpen Development Cambodia collected the data from a variety of public domain sources such as the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes, company websites, and news reports.",

        "Overview": "The mining sector in Cambodia is mostly undeveloped, and active mining enterprises are typically small-scale quarries producing materials for construction, such as laterite, marble, granite, limestone, gravel and sand. There are also thousands of artisanal miners recovering gold and gemstones, often on a seasonal or part-time basis. There is no industrial-scale extraction of minerals, although many exploration licenses have been granted to mining companies and some have reported promising finds of gold. The mining law states that all mining in \u201cnational cultural, historical and heritage sites\u201d is prohibited, and mining activities in \u201cprotected, reserved or restricted\u201d areas can only be carried out with written permission of the authority responsible. The 2002 Law on Forestry allows mining within the permanent forest estate, however, any proposed mining operation must be the subject of a \u2018prior study-evaluation\u2019 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The legality of mining operations on lands traditionally managed by indigenous people requires clarification.\n\nThis dataset contains data for mining licenses in Cambodia with contract dates starting from 1995 to 2014. Due to the lack of publicly available information, this dataset does not include information on implementation status of mines or change in ownership of mining licenses.\n\nOpen Development Cambodia collected the data from a variety of public domain sources such as the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes, company websites, and news reports.",

        "Overview": "This data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.\n\nGiven the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.\n\nEach polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A \u201cgr\u201d in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:\n\nLarge industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares\nMosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use\nMosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.\nClearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)\nFor more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.",

        "Overview": "A protected area is a defined space given extra protection to support long-term conservation of wildlife, nature, ecosystems and cultures. The 1993 Royal Decree on the Protection of Natural Areas recognized 23 protected areas, which at the time covered over 18% of Cambodia\u2019s land area. The royal decree establishes four categories: national park, wildlife sanctuary, protected landscape, and multi-purpose (multiple use) areas necessary for the stability of the water, forestry, wildlife, and fisheries resource, for pleasure, and for the conservation of nature with a view of assuring economic development. In 2008, the Royal Government of Cambodia adopted the [Law on Protected Areas](http://www.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/pdf-viewer/?pdf=download/law/Law%20on%20Natural%20Protected%20Areas_February_15_2008_Khm.pdf) introducing and defining a new zoning system to manage the protected areas in Cambodia.\n\nThe law, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment, underlines the expansion and modification of protected areas categories which additionally include the Ramsar sites, biosphere reserves, natural heritage sites and marine parks. Since the Protected Areas Law was passed, numerous sub-decrees have been passed classifying areas as Sustainable Use Zones (degazettement). According to the law, after consulting with relevant ministries and institutions, local authorities, and local communities, the Government may permit development and investment activities in these zones. These activities can include infrastructure development, including irrigation and hydroelectricity projects, mining and resin exploitation.\n\nThis dataset contains data for five types of protected areas in Cambodia (national park, wildlife sanctuary, protected landscape, multiple use, Ramsar site) with issuing dates starting from 1993 to 2014. Data for biosphere reserves, national heritage sites, and marine parks is currently not available on ODC. Due to the lack of publicly available spatial information on zoning and degazettement of protected areas, this dataset does not include information on adjustments.\n\nOpen Development Cambodia collected the data from a variety of public domain sources such as the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes, company websites, and news reports.",

It uses satellite data from MODIS vegetation indices (MOD13Q1 and NDVI) and products related to presence of water bodies (MOD35) as well as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data to detect anthropogenic changes in vegetation cover every 16 days. Terra-i is a collaboration between the [International Center for Tropical Agriculture](http://ciat.cgiar.org/) (CIAT - DAPA), CGIAR\u2019s Research Program on Forestry, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HEIG-VD), and King\u2019s College London (KCL).\n\nThe system is based on the premise that natural vegetation follows a predictable pattern of change in greenness from one date to the next, brought about by site-specific land and climatic conditions over the same period. The model is trained to understand the normal pattern of changes in vegetation greenness in relation to terrain and rainfall for a site, which allows for prediction of what the next vegetation response should be based on the historical data. If the prediction is significantly different from the historical responses in relation to pattern of rainfall and lasts for two 16-day periods in a row, the pixel is marked as potentially having changed by anthropogenic means.\n",

        "Overview": "This data set provides the boundaries of known Licenses for Planted Forests (LPFs) within Sarawak, Malaysia. LPFs have a maximum tenure of 60 years, and must be over 1,000 hectares in size. Though they are designed for the purpose of planting of timber trees (mostly acacia), licensees are permitted to plant a portion of their licensed area with oil palm trees for a single rotation.\n\nThe data set combines the boundaries of LPFs issued up to and included on the Sarawak Forestry Department (SFD) LPF map published 11th Jan 2011. Precise boundaries were sourced from regional SFD maps from 2010 and from Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for individual concessions.\n\nLicenses (and licensee subsidiaries) have been attributed to major corporate groups based on published company records and secondary sources. Where information on the areas within LPFs allotted for oil palm is available, the boundaries of these areas have been plotted and included in the separate dataset on oil palm concessions in Sarawak. Information on the permit issuance date, official total area in hectares, and plantable area in hectares for LPF licenses has been obtained directly from EIA reports or from secondary sources which have drawn on such reports. Information on area of each LPF license planted up to 2012 (where provided) has been obtained from official published reports or websites of relevant companies.\n\nIt should be noted that it is common for LPF licenses to overlap with current Timber Licenses (see separate logging concession dataset for Sarawak). In such instances, LPF clearance and planting only proceeds in individual zones within the LPF when the Timber License holder has completed its own activities.",

These areas are divided in three categories of use: indirect use, direct use, and reserved zone.\n\n\nAreas of indirect use\n\nIn indirect areas, the extraction of natural resources or other types of environmental modification are not allowed. These areas only permit non-manipulative scientific investigation and tourist, recreational, educational, and cultural activities under regulated conditions. The following are indirect use areas:\n\nNational Parks: created in areas that represent the large ecological units in the country. In these areas, SERNANP protects the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems, the associations of wild plants and animals, successional and evolutionary processes, as well as landscape and cultural characteristics. In this areas, hunting, ranching, farming, timber, or mining activities, or any activity that exploits natural resources, cannot be developed.\n\nNational Sanctuaries: areas where the habitat of a species or a community of flora or fauna is protected, as natural formations of scientific interest and national importance.\n\nHistorical Sanctuaries: areas that in addition to protecting natural values, show the the monumental and archaeological heritage of the country, or are areas where outstanding historical events took place.\n\n\nAreas of direct use\n\nIn direct use areas, the use of natural resources is allowed, primarily by local people, under the guidelines of a Management Plan approved and supervised by the relevant national authority. The following are direct use areas:\n\nNational Reserves: areas dedicated to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including commercial use, of wild flora and fauna under management plans, with the exception of commercial forest use for timber\n\nLandscape Reserves: areas where environments with geographical integrity are protected, housing important natural, cultural, and aesthetic values. If the prior zonification allows it, these areas can permit traditional use of natural resources, scientific investigation, tourism, and human settlements. Activities that cause notable changes in the landscape and the value of the area are excluded\n\nProtected Forests: areas that are established to protect important watersheds, the banks of rivers and other water bodies, and stop erosion of fragile lands. In this areas, the use of resources and the development of activities are allowed, provided that those activities do not affect vegetation cover, fragile soils, or water flow.\n\nCommunal Reserves: areas dedicated to the conservation of wild flora and fauna for the benefit of neighboring rural people who are using resources traditionally. The use and commercialization of resources is done under management plans, approved and supervised by the government authority and conducted by the beneficiary populations.\n\nHunting Preserves: areas dedicated to the use of wild fauna through the regulated practice of sport hunting.\n\nWildlife Refuges: areas that require active intervention to guarantee the maintenance and recuperation of habitats and populations of particular species. These areas exclude commercial use of natural resources that could significantly change the habitat.\n\n\nReserved Zones:\n\nIn addition to the above categories, Reserved Zones are established as a transitory category in areas that have the conditions necessary to be considered as a natural protected area, but that require additional study to determine their extension and category, among other things.",

        "Overview": "The PRODES project monitors clear cut deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, and has produced annual deforestation rates for the region since 1988. The Brazilian government uses these figures to establish public policy, including defining access to credit in the Amazon biome, establishing deforestation reduction goals, and soliciting funds to reduce deforestation. PRODES historically used Landsat 5 images, but now also incorporates imagery from Landsat 7 and 8, CBERS-2, CBERS-2B, Resourcesat-1, and UK2-DMC. PRODES is operated by the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) and the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). Since 2002, all PRODES data is publicly available online.\n\nInput images for each of the 220 Landsat footprints that cover the Brazilian Amazon are selected based on their lack of cloud cover and their capture date. The PRODES system uses the seasonal year, starting on August 1st, to calculate annual deforestation, so images are selected as near to this date as possible (generally from July, August, and September). From 2003 to 2005, analysts used image transformation to determine the components of vegetation, soil, and shadow using the program SPRING. These components were segmented and classified into the classes of forest, non-forest, deforestation in the target year, previous deforestation, clouds, and water, which are then manually corrected by experts. Starting in 2005, a new methodology was implemented which makes use of the open source TerraAmazon platform. The platform allows the PRODES analysis to be more uniform and can incorporate imagery from a variety of satellites. As before, images are selected to be as cloud free as possible. The images are then masked to exclude non-forest, previous deforestation, and water using the previous year\u2019s analysis. Analysts then delineate deforested polygons in the intact forest of the previous year. More information on the methodology can be found on the [PRODES website](http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/index.php).\n\nThis data set shows deforestation from 1997-2000, and annual deforestation between 2000 and 2015.",

Soil organic carbon is a major component of soil organic matter, which is derived from residual, decomposed plant and animal material. Natural factors, such as land cover, vegetation, topography and climate, as well as man-made factors, such as land use and management, can influence the amount of soil organic matter, and thus soil organic carbon, present in soils.\n\nTo calculate topsoil organic carbon, we use data from the [Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/index.html?sb=1), a compilation of four soil databases: the European Soil Database (ESDB), the 1:1 million soil map of China, various regional SOTER databases (SOTWIS Database), and the Soil Map of the World. The HWSD contains information on soil parameters, such as organic carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, total exchangeable nutrients and salinity.\n\nTopsoil organic carbon (measured in tons per hectare) was calculated using inputs of percent carbon content, bulk density, and gravel volume. We use relative bulk density values except for Andosols and Histosols, which are typically overestimated by this method. Values are calculated for 0-30 cm depth. See more information on calculating SOC from the HWSD [here](http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdb_archive/eusoils_docs/other/EUR25225.pdf).",

The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM), the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. Over 1 million satellite images were processed and analyzed, including over 600,000 Landsat 7 images for the 2000-2012 interval, and approximately 400,000 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images for updates for the 2011-2014 interval. The clear land surface observations in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss.\n\nIn this data set, \u201ctree cover\u201d is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. Tree cover loss is defined as \u201cstand replacement disturbance,\u201d or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may be the result of human activities, including forestry practices such as timber harvesting or deforestation (the conversion of natural forest to other land uses), as well as natural causes such as disease or storm damage. Fire is another widespread cause of tree cover loss, and can be either natural or human-induced.\n\nThis data set has been updated twice since its creation, and now includes loss up to 2014 (Version 1.2). The analysis method has been modified in numerous ways, including new data for the target year, re-processed data for the previous two years (2011 and 2012 for the Version 1.1 update, 2012 and 2013 for the Version 1.2 update), and improved modelling and calibration. These modifications improve change detection for 2011-2014, including better detection of boreal loss due to fire, smallholder rotation agriculture in tropical forests, selective losing, and short cycle plantations. Eventually, a future \u201cVersion 2.0\u201d will include reprocessing for 2000-2010 data, but in the meantime integrated use of the original data and Version 1.2 should be performed with caution. Read more about the Version 1.2 update [here](http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.2.html).\n\nWhen zoomed out (< zoom level 13), pixels of loss are shaded according to the density of loss at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration of tree cover loss, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover loss. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (\u2265 zoom level 13).\n\nThe tree cover canopy density of the displayed data varies according to the selection - use the legend on the map to change the minimum tree cover canopy density threshold.\n",

The data has 33% omission errors, though most of these occur in secondary forests where tree cover and other vegetation are more difficult to distinguish.

Pixels with no change are transparent.\n\nThe National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011) is the most recent national data product created by the United States [Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC)](http://www.mrlc.gov/index.php) Consortium. The MRLC is a group of federal agencies who coordinate and generate consistent and relevant land cover information at the national scale for a wide variety of environmental, land management, and modeling applications. NLCD 2011 provides - for the first time - the capability to assess wall-to-wall, spatially explicit, national land cover changes and trends across the United States from 2001 to 2011. As with two previous NLCD land cover products NLCD 2011 keeps the same 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2011 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2011 Landsat satellite data.\n\nThe 2001/2011 land cover change layer is one of five primary data products produced as part of the NLCD 2011: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover.\n\nLand cover class categories include forest, planted/cultivated lands, wetland, grassland, water, developed areas and barren land. Land cover information is critical for local, state, and federal managers and officials to assist them with issues such as assessing ecosystem status and health, modeling nutrient and pesticide runoff, understanding spatial patterns of biodiversity, land use planning, deriving landscape pattern metrics, and developing land management policies",

Protected area data are provided via [Protected Planet](protectedplanet.net), the online interface for the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). The WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas.\n\n[IUCN Management Categories](http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/)\n\nNot all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](http://www.iucn.org/) defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.\n\nAs you click through protected areas in this layer, note the \u201clegal designation\u201d and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.\n\nIa. Strict Nature Reserves. Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area\u2019s high level of preservation. Other common designations: Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve\n\nIb. Wilderness Areas. Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor\u2019s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. Other common designations: Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area\n\nII. National Parks. Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. Other common designations: State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park\n\nIII. National Monuments or Features. Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. Other common designations: Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden\n\nIV. Habitat and Species Management Areas. Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. Other common designations: National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nV. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes. Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region\u2019s management plan. Other common designations: National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area\n\nVI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. Other common designations: Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve\n\n[UNESCO-MAP Biosphere Reserves](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/): areas under UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere Programme designated to \u201cpromote sustainable development based on local community efforts and sound science.\u201d\n\n[World Heritage Sites](http://whc.unesco.org/): areas considered to have \u201coutstanding universal value\u201d and meet at least one of ten criteria, as described [here](http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/).\n\n[Ramsar Sites\u2014Wetlands of International Importance](http://www.ramsar.org/): wetlands that hold significant value designated under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.",
